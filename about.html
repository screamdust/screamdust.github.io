						<div id="context" class="life-story">
							<p> I was born and grew up in a small city of Rivne, located in Western Ukraine. My father is a truck-driver so 60% of the year I was with my mom only. As a boy I was crazy about the football and the dream of
							of becoming a pro-player didn`t seem so unreal after our school team got 2nd place on city tournament. The misery awaited right after that, as doctors have discovered Shlatter disease, thus preventing me from
							doing sports in the next 6 years. At first, I did not really like the school as studying was quite boring process, yet after the football incident my view has changed. I began seeing the beauty of education from the
							new angle. By the age of 16, I actually loved learning (studying was still boring though). This love pushed me to keep pursuing education after school. </p>
						</div>
						<div id="context2" class="life-story">
							<p> The choise of University is often troublesome for young people. How can you ensure that you are going to get high-quality education that is actually valuable for real life. Even more so bothers the question whether you will be able
							to keep up with new pace of life, where the process of studying is the vital for survivability. At the time of me choosing among numerous options, my father just moved to work in Klaipeda, Lithuania and had discovered about
							LCC International University from his collegue. The American-style University with strong emphasis on leadership that values practical skills - from the very beggining it seemed so perfect...Hardly imaginable.
							I discovered about the mate from my city, who studied there at time so I used my chanse and contacted him to get to know more. Our conversation made me feel like that was the great place to go for things student wish to get.
							My naive dream of "making the world" better forced me to choose the International Relations Major. Thus I`m here studying.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="context3" class="life-story">
							<p> At LCC I learned a lot about different culture due to the immense number of different culture that students come from. There are over 20 countries represented by LCC students community that helped a lot to make every single experience
							vivid and unforgettable. I became especially pattionate about the development and wanted to learn as much on the topic as I could. Thankfully, the scholars that came from U.S., Beliz or Japan all contributed to
							extend my knowledge and I am really glad about having the chanse to learn from them. </p>
						</div>
						<div id="context4" class="life-story">
							<p> Now, I am looking forward to apply all my knowledge to the best of the worldwide community. I feel that diverse perspectives and critical thinking promoted in LCC will help me to reach my dream and ultimately enhance the living conditions. 
							Everyday, somebody in the "Third World Country" experience hunger or political pressure and even if I could help one person a day my life would be worth. As for You, dear Reader, I wish You great success in all Your begginings
							and remember - dreams come true, but You have to work for that! </p>
						</div>
						<div id="geography">
							<p> Since the early childhood, I always dreamt of seeing the world. It is incredibly valuable experience to learn other cultures and discover new places and friends. Fortunately, I had quite a few chanses to travel 
							and thus far have been to some remarkable places. Here are some of them </p>
