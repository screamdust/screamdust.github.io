						<p> I was born in city of Rivne, Ukraine. However, the life rushed me to explore undiscovered horizonts and thus, I have ended up studying in Lithuania, at

						<p> "Who you wonna be upon growing up?" The question every kid had faced numerous times. Indeed, everyone of us has had a dream of becoming an astrounaut, pilot or surgeoun. I was not an exception and had a list of potential professions starting up with a dream of becoming president to a pilot. 
						However, fresh mind was prone to change preferences in profession rather quickly and thus I turned to a "first love" of many boys all over the world - soccer. I actively trained everyday thinking of perspective of becoming new Ronaldo or Messi, but the sudden news about Osgoodâ€“Schlatter disease made it impossible to continue aiming for soccer career.

						<p> Surely, after short-lasting "footbal career", I thought of different direction for professional development that has had range of option. At first I thought of lawyer or economist career as at the time these arose to be rather prestigious occupations.
						But one idea did not let me become definite about future, and thus I kept going on thinking. Until, certain dramatic changes in Ukrainian political arena, I doubted my decision but certain personal events in addition to the country`s domestic affairs made me definite.
						The one thing that I wanted the most brightly inspired my choise - I wanted to help the people. This naive idea pushed me think how best can I employ the skills I possess to produce best possible outcome for the humanity. Hence the International Relations and Development Program became my choice.

						<p> Studying 1000 km away from home is not the easy thing, indeed. But diverse community of LCC (many of whom came from way farer than I) as well as my child dream of being a part of a change kept me going. The experince that I gained throughout 4 years of studying here have already become the part of my dream
